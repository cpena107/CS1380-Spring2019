# **Course Description:**

#      An introduction to computer science and computer programming is given, in which the fundamentals of a high-level programming language will be introduced. Methods of problem-solving, techniques of algorithmic development and concepts of structured object oriented programming will be emphasized.

#       **Important:** Computer Science majors/minors-Computer Engineering majors must take CSCI 1370/1170-CMPE 1370/1170 instead.

# **Prerequisites:**

     Concurrent enrollment or credit for MATH 1314 or placement in a higher level mathematics course.

# **Textbook:**

     - Recommended: C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures By D. S. Malik Edition: 5, illustrated Published by Course Technology, Cengage Learning, 2011 ISBN-13 978-0-538-79809-9, ISBN-10 0-538-79809-2. You may want to check www.bookfinder.com for used books or www.chegg.com for book rentals, among other sites. Local bookstores also rent this book.

**Note:** Notice this book is recommended, not required, and so almost any C++ book should suffice (other versions of this book or even books from other authors).

# **Course Topics:**

     This course will concentrate on techniques of problem solving and algorithmic design and will include lab experiences in the design and implementation of those algorithms in C++. C++ topics will include interactive input/output statements, file input and output statements, assignment statements, simple data types, selection and looping statements, functions, one and two dimensional arrays, user-defined data types, and structured data types. Time permitting, data abstraction and classes will be introduced.

**Course Objectives:**  After completing this course, the student should be able to:

     Understand and carry out the steps involved in solving a problem using the computer, including the analysis, design, implementation, documentation and testing phases using methods of structured, modular and top-down style.

     Be proficient with the programming environment and understand the system hardware, software and aspects of program translation.

     Choose appropriate algorithms and data structures and proper syntax for problems involving selection control structures, various looping structures, procedures and functions, and for problems requiring array and other structures.

**Learning Outcomes:**

     Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

# 1. Be proficient with the programming environment and understand the basic aspects of program translation.

# 2. Analyze a programming problem and develop a solution algorithm.

# 3. Use the syntax and semantics of a higher-level language to implement their solutions to programming problems, including the correct use of:

# a. Variables and assignment to variables,

# b. Primitive types such as integer, character, and floating-point variable types,

# c. Commonly-used built-in reference types, e.g., single-dimensional arrays, strings,

# d. Declaration of constants and variables,

# e. Assignment, logical, and arithmetic operators,

# f. Local and global variables,

# g. Selective control structures (e.g., if, nested if, switch),

# h. Iterative control structures (e.g., for, while),

# i. Functions (user-defined and predefined),

# j. Parameter passing to functions (by value and by reference),

# k. Arrays and other structures (such as records).

# 4. Document their solutions.

# 5. Use functions and parameter passing involving both primitive types and reference types.

# 6. Apply problem-solving strategies to design a solution to a problem similar to ones seen before.

# 7. Design simple ADTs to solve a problem similar to one seen before.

# 8. Apply testing and debugging strategies, including black-box and white-box testing, test drivers, stubs, to identify software faults.

# 9. Formulate complex arithmetic expressions involving operators of differing precedence and associativity, and understand the order of evaluation of sub-expressions.

# 10. Formulate complex logical expressions involving multiple and/or/not combinations.

# 11. Implement nested if statements.

# 12. Demonstrate proficiency in the use of logic and arithmetic operators and their precedence.

# **Course Grading Policies:**

     3 Tests                                36% (12% per exam)

     Homework Assignments                32% (see LAB/HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS EVALUATION CRITERIA)

     Lab Assignments                        32% (see LAB/HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS EVALUATION CRITERIA)

**Important:** I DO NOT do extra credit so make sure you get good grades in tests and assignments in order to get a good final grade.

Your final grade will be based on the following scale:

     A:  90-100%      B: 80-89%    C: 70-79%    D:  60-69%     F:  0-59%

**General Course Policies:**

- **Attendance.** _ _I assume that you will attend class, be punctual, remain on task, and stay through the entire class meeting.
- If you miss more than 10% of the classes without a valid excuse you will be reported to the Early Warning System program. UTRGV&#39;s attendance policy excuses students from attending class if they are participating in officially sponsored university activities, such as athletics; for observance of religious holy days; or for military service. Oher acceptable excuses include (but are not limited to) the death of an immediate family member, or an illness requiring a physician&#39;s attention.
- **Completion of exams and assignments.** You must take **all** exams and turn in **all** assignments on time. If you miss any of the work for the course, you must speak to me as soon as possible so that I can determine if I will allow you to make up the missed work. Depending on the excuse provided, make-up exams may result in automatic loss of points. All exams must be taken to be able to pass the course, missing anyone will result in an F as a final grade.
- **Scholastic integrity.** As members of a community dedicated to Honesty, Integrity and Respect, students are reminded that those who engage in scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and expulsion from the University. Scholastic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: cheating, plagiarism, and collusion; submission for credit of any work or materials that are attributable in whole or in part to another person; taking an examination for another person; any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student; or the attempt to commit such acts. Since scholastic dishonesty harms the individual, all students and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced (Board of Regents Rules and Regulations and UTRGV Academic Integrity Guidelines). All scholastic dishonesty incidents will be reported to the Dean of Students.
- **Course drops.** According to UTRGV policy, students may drop any class without penalty earning a grade of DR until the official drop date. Following that date, students must be assigned a letter grade and can no longer drop the class. Students considering dropping the class should be aware of the &quot;3-peat rule&quot; and the &quot;6-drop&quot; rule so they can recognize how dropped classes may affect their academic success. The 6-drop rule refers to Texas law that dictates that undergraduate students may not drop more than six courses during their undergraduate career. Courses dropped at other Texas public higher education institutions will count toward the six-course drop limit. The 3-peat rule refers to additional fees charged to students who take the same class for the third time.
- You are responsible for saving and backing up your own assignment files. If you lose a file, you must start the assignment over again. I will give NO special consideration or extensions for lost files.

**Homework Assignment Policies:**

     Programs will be graded on correctness, efficiency, quality of design, documentation and style. Late homework assignments may be accepted with a penalty of 10% if submitted within 24 hours after its deadline. A homework assignment may be the accepted afterward but the student will get 0 points for it.

**     Students may work individually or in pairs** to develop the solution for the problem. **All programming assignments are expected to be the individual/team&#39;s own work**. **Giving** and **receiving** major sections of code is considered cheating and will be dealt with on an individual basis (beginning with total loss of points followed by formal action). They are also encouraged to seek help with identifying syntax and run-time errors from SAs, lab consultants, or the instructor during office hours.

# **Lab Assignment Policies:**

     The purpose of the lab assignments is to apply the concepts learned in lectures and to develop team-working skills. **Students MUST work in pairs** to develop the solution for the problem and the lab component of their final grade will depend on  the group as well as the individual accomplishments. The programs are very simple and thus students are advised to work on them as soon as they become available so the day of the lab, they should just &quot;polish&quot; the programs (if necessary with help from SAs and the instructor) during the labs to ensure that they comply with the specifications. Late lab assignments will be accepted with a penalty of 10% if submitted within 24 hours after its deadline.

      The programs&#39; specifications will be posted on Blackboard a couple of days in advance to the lab.

**All assignments (lab and homework) must be submitted using the tool provided by**  **Blackboard** **to submit assignments (sorry but no email attachments).**

**Expectations:**

     I am committed to quality teaching and to providing you a meaningful experience in this course but learning is your responsibility so please do your part in order to receive the maximum benefit from the course.

For this class, **I expect you to** :

- **Have your electronic devices (cell phones, notebooks, music players, etc.) OFF at all times (tests, lectures and labs)****.**
- Attend each class, arrive on time and remain in the classroom throughout the entire class meeting.  If you have a legitimate and important reason for needing to leave early, please let me know before class starts.
- Complete all assignments and submit them on time (this is very important for you!).
- Interact respectfully with me, the course assistants, and your other classmates.
- Participate in class discussions and activities.
- **Remain on task and focused during class (****i.e., **** no doing homework, engaging in side conversations, web-surfing, reading e-mail, Facebooking, chatting, IMing, **** etc****. during class).**
- Access your Blackboard account frequently to get information on course policies, assignments, tests, grades, etc. **All information posted on it will be assumed to be known by the student 24 hours later.**

- Do **Not** bring **food** or **drinks** into the lab please. This is a real issue around computers.
- Come speak to me IN PERSON and IMMEDIATELY at the **first** sign that you are having trouble with the class or if you miss assignments so I can try to help you.

**Communication – IMPORTANT NOTICE:**

     It is UTRGV policy that all electronic communication related to university activity/business must use university systems. Thus, you **MUST** communicate with me through **Blackboard Messages** or (if Blackboard is not available) through your **UTRGV** e-mail account.

Whether you send a message in Blackboard or an e-mail through your UTRGV account, please ensure that all your messages have the following:

-
  - Descriptive subject line.
  - Your name, course number and section (if e-mailing from your UTRGV account), and a clear statement of your question or problem. If you send an attachment, please explain it.
  - An e-mail is a relatively formal communication, so please ensure your language reflects that fact (be polite, avoid acronyms, use punctuation marks, capitalize, etc.). For example, fyi tina (For your information, this is not acceptable).

**Special Problems/Note to students with disabilities:**

     Students with a documented disability (physical, psychological, learning, or other disability which affects academic performance) who would like to receive academic accommodations should contact **Student Accessibility Services (SAS)** as soon as possible to schedule an appointment to initiate services.  Accommodations can be arranged through SAS at any time, but are not retroactive.  Students who suffer a broken bone, severe injury or undergo surgery during the semester are eligible for temporary services.

**SEXUAL HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, and VIOLENCE** :

     In accordance with UT System regulations, your instructor is a &quot;Responsible Employee&quot; for reporting purposes under Title IX regulations and so must report any instance, occurring during a student&#39;s time in college, of sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence, or sexual harassment about which she/he becomes aware during this course through writing, discussion, or personal disclosure. More information can be found at www.utrgv.edu/equity, including confidential resources available on campus. The faculty and staff of UTRGV actively strive to provide a learning, working, and living environment that promotes personal integrity, civility, and mutual respect that is free from sexual misconduct and discrimination.

**LAB/HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS EVALUATION CRITERIA**

**LAB (Team work)**

1)        Students MUST work in pairs in labs.

2)        The program MUST follow STRICTLY the instructions on the handout. Failing to do so, will cost you points. If you want to try other solutions, you can do so but as a separate program. The program that you will be required to show, explain, and submit will be the one specified on the handout.

3)        The student MUST be able to explain to the instructor or SA (Student Assistant) any part of the program.

4)        Although this is team work, each individual member of the team is still responsible for the submission of the assignment. That is, you cannot blame your partner for not submitting it (on time or anything at all).

**HOMEWORK (Individual work)**

1)        This is, in principle, individual work but students may do it in two members-teams (pair programming) if they wish. To be allowed to work in pairs, one of the team members will have to post a message in the corresponding topic of the Discussion Board of Blackboard stating the name of the members at least one week before their first work together. The team MUST work together for at least three homework assignments. Switching of team members MUST be authorized by the instructor.

2)        If working in pairs, it is expected that BOTH members of the team work together on EACH problem, not each member on a separated problem.

3)        Teams/individuals can share ideas on the general solution of the problem but cannot share actual code. If this situation is detected, BOTH teams/individuals (the one given the code as well as the one receiving it) will get 0 (ZERO) points and a warning from the instructor. A second instance of copying will be dealt according to the HOP (Handbook of Operating Procedures) specifications, that is, report to the Dean of Students and whatever action derives from that.



        Students/teams can provide LIMITED help to other classmates/teams. Providing full sections of code is NOT allowed.

Examples of help that can be provided are:

a) Pinpointing an error such as a missing semicolon at the end of the statement.

b) Mentioning a missing declaration of a variable or named constant.

c) Describing the wrong use of data types in an expression.

d) Discussing the general type of structure to be used in the solution (when allowed)

If you have any doubts, consult with the instructor.

**ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS**

        There will be in every test questions assessing your participation in the solution of homework and lab assignments. Thus, it is important that you and your partner clearly understand what was done in every program submitted. These questions will ask you to do something similar to what you did for your assignments. Their grade (AG: Assessment Grade) will range from 0.0 to 1.0 and will be used to calculate your final grade according the formula shown below.

**GRADING CRITERIA**

        The following general criteria will be used to grade homework and lab assignments:

1) Missing or too few comments in the source program: -5 points.

2) Missing source files (.cpp): -100% of what the program is worth.

3) Non-working programs (do not compile or do not do what are supposed to do): -100% of what the program is worth.

4) Missing algorithm: -10 points.

5) Other errors such as not checking for problems when opening files, not using the right type of variable, logical errors, using the wrong type of structure, etc.: from -5 to -10 points depending on the severity of the mistake.

6) Warnings generated by the compiler: -5 points.

7) Late submission: -10 points.

        These general criteria may be modified under particular circumstances. As the semester progresses, more criteria may eventually be added to the above.

Your final grade will be calculated using the following formula:

FG = TGA\*.36 + HGA\*.32\*OAGA + LGA\*.32\*OAGA + 5\*OAGA\*PAGA

FG: Final Grade

TGA: Tests Grade Average (0-100)

HGA: Homework Grade Average (0-100)

LGA: Labs Grade Average (0-100)

OAGA: Own Assessment Grade Average (0.0-1.0)

PAGA: Partner Assessment Grade Average (0.0-1.0)

The last term in the formula (5\*OAGA\*PAGA) can add up to 5 points to your final grade and it will depend on yours and your partner&#39;s assessment grades in tests. It is called **Team Work Incentive**.

Your homework and lab assignments components will be affected by your own assessment grade in tests.
